# Chapter 3 â€“ Exploring the System

This chapter goes into layers of the onion that is the Linux filesystem, away
from familiar Home, Downloads, and Documents directories.

The three big commands in this chapter are `ls`, `file`, and `less`, which are,
to put it mildly, very boring. However, there's a lot of good content in this
chapter, namely these sections:

  1. Options and Arguments section, covering ways to modify commands
  2. Taking a Guided Tour section, covering the structure of linux systems
  3. Symbollic and Hard Links sections, at the end

## Some TL;DRs

  - Most of the time, if `ls` isn't enough, try `ls -alh`.
  - If you want to quickly see what's in a file, use `less <filename>`
  - If you want to see the top or bottom of a file, use `head` and `tail`
